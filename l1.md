today we're going to talk about some adjecrtives, of course . But we're also going to talk about some emphasis words that you can use to kind of more deeply explain yourslef.

First two words are yummy and tasty . So a couple very casuals words.

<Tasty>, is used kind of caasually we use it just for like everyday common food. There is no nuance of something liek elegant , like refinement about si=omething.

<YUMMY> Kids use this word again for kind of simple, jubky and sugary food . But most of the time children can use the word yummy. Adults can use the word to kindd of create a nuance of child like enjoyment sort of thing. Wed on't really use yummy in a way like some nice food.

So these are the first two words. I'm gonna move on ot a couple wordsof words many people confuse.

<SPICY> <HOT>, when we talk anbout uncomfortable in our moouth, something tha has many peppers , that we want to drink after the milk. Temparaturre vs peppers. But hot we ccan usse for _both of those_. Spicy we can refer to temparature

a couple more words . keep these words on your head
